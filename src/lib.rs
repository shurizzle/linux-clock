/// A measurement of a monotonically nondecreasing clock.
/// Opaque and useful only with [`Duration`].
///
/// Instants are always guaranteed, barring [platform bugs], to be no less than any previously
/// measured instant when created, and are often useful for tasks such as measuring
/// benchmarks or timing how long an operation takes.
///
/// Note, however, that instants are **not** guaranteed to be **steady**. In other
/// words, each tick of the underlying clock might not be the same length (e.g.
/// some seconds may be longer than others). An instant may jump forwards or
/// experience time dilation (slow down or speed up), but it will never go
/// backwards.
///
/// Instants are opaque types that can only be compared to one another. There is
/// no method to get "the number of seconds" from an instant. Instead, it only
/// allows measuring the duration between two instants (or comparing two
/// instants).
///
/// The size of an `Instant` struct may vary depending on the target operating
/// system.
///
/// Example:
///
/// ```no_run
/// use unix_clock::Instant;
/// use std::time::Duration;
/// use std::thread::sleep;
///
/// fn main() {
///    let now = Instant::now();
///
///    // we sleep for 2 seconds
///    sleep(Duration::new(2, 0));
///    // it prints '2'
///    println!("{}", now.elapsed().as_secs());
/// }
/// ```
///
/// [platform bugs]: Instant#monotonicity
///
/// > Note: mathematical operations like `add` may panic if the underlying
/// > structure cannot represent the new point in time.
///
/// ## Monotonicity
///
/// Guarantees are – under rare circumstances – broken by hardware, virtualization
/// or operating system bugs. To work around these bugs and platforms not offering monotonic clocks
/// [`duration_since`], [`elapsed`] and `sub` saturate to zero. In older Rust versions this
/// lead to a panic instead. [`checked_duration_since`] can be used to detect and handle situations
/// where monotonicity is violated, or `Instant`s are subtracted in the wrong order.
///
/// This workaround obscures programming errors where earlier and later instants are accidentally
/// swapped. For this reason future rust versions may reintroduce panics.

/// A measurement of the system clock, useful for talking to
/// external entities like the file system or other processes.
///
/// Distinct from the [`Instant`] type, this time measurement **is not
/// monotonic**. This means that you can save a file to the file system, then
/// save another file to the file system, **and the second file has a
/// `SystemTime` measurement earlier than the first**. In other words, an
/// operation that happens after another operation in real time may have an
/// earlier `SystemTime`!
///
/// Consequently, comparing two `SystemTime` instances to learn about the
/// duration between them returns a [`Result`] instead of an infallible [`Duration`]
/// to indicate that this sort of time drift may happen and needs to be handled.
///
/// Although a `SystemTime` cannot be directly inspected, the [`UNIX_EPOCH`]
/// constant is provided in this module as an anchor in time to learn
/// information about a `SystemTime`. By calculating the duration from this
/// fixed point in time, a `SystemTime` can be converted to a human-readable time,
/// or perhaps some other string representation.
